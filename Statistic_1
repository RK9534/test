------------------ STATISTIC ------------------------
* It is a branch of Mathematics deals with collection, organisation and interpretation of DATA.

Two Categories:

1) Descriptive Stats:
	* presenting, organising and summarizing of DATA.

2) Inferential Stats:
	* Drawing conclusion about a population based on DATA observed in a sample.


Q)What is DATA?
A)It is a Raw information or a text.

Q)What is DATASET?
A)Meaningful DATA

Q)How many type of DATA?
A) There are three categories of DATA:

* Cross-Sectional DATA:
	* Data for a certain time period or a particular time frame.
* Time-Series DATA:
	* Data for a long duration like 10 year, 20 year..ex finance data.
* Panel DATA:
	* Data which is cross sectional and time series by nature.
	like amazon sales for last 5 year with that product information.

Q)What include in DATASET?
A) there are basically two categories:
* Qualitative (Quality): Categorical Data
	ex: gender as male or female..
* Quantitative (Quantity): Numerical data
	ex: sales revenue
		* Continuos: infinite values
			ex: sales revenue
		* Discrete: finite values
			ex: sales period

Q)How to measure the diffrent type of DATASETS?
A) Scale of Measurment:
	* Categorical:
		* Nominal: name of category data
			ex: male as 01 female as 02
		* Ordinal: order of category data.
			ex: 100mtr race the data is in order as 1st, 2nd, 3rd and so on..

	* Numerical:
		* Interval: Analysing data for same time diffrence.
			ex: measuring of temp at 10 degree to 20 degree and 40 degree to 50 degree,in both cases we are measuring 10 degree data.
		* Ratio: Analysing data for some change in time frame.
			ex: measuring of temp at 10 degree to 20 degree and 40 degree to 60 degree,in this senario the data which is measured are in the ratio of 1:2.

NOTE: Scale of Measurement: NOIR

** Insight DATASET.
* Population: Raw Datasets or complete Datasets(100TB)
* Sample: Taking sample from raw datasets (1TB)

**SIDE NOTE:** For sample the columns/variables must be same as in population and always take random samples.
df = pd.read_csv('')
df.shape >> 32400897, 26
df_sample = df.sample(0.30,random_state=1)

-----------------------------------------------------
Descriptive Stats:

* Measure of Central Tendency or Central Value:
	* Mean (Average)
	* Median (Mid Value)
		* If even series take average of mid two value
		* If odd series take mid value
	* Mode (Most frequent item)
		* Uni-Modal: one mode
		* Bi-Modal: more than one mode
		* No-Modal: No mode

Example:
20, 45, 50, 35, 20, 25, 18, 1, 20, 100

Mean: Sum of All Number
	 ---------------------
	    Total Number
Mean = 20+45+50+35+20+25+18+1+20+100 / 10
	 = 334/10
	 = 33.4

Median: It is a even series so we will take average of mid two.
	 = 20 + 25 / 2
	 = 45/2
	 = 22.5

Mode: 20

* Measure of variability:
	* Range: Diffrence b/w largest to the smallest i.e (Max - Min)

	* Variance: How far the number are spread out.
		sum(x-mean(x))^2 / n

	* Standard Deviation: How much variance or variation exists from the mean.
		 square root(variance)

Example:
X 	X-mean(X) 	X-mean(X)^2
2 		-2 			4
3		-1			1
4		0			0
5		1			1
6		2			4

			Sum of = 10


Range: 6-2 = 4
mean(x) = 2+3+4+5+6/5 = 4
Variance = 10/5 = 2
SD = root(2) = 1.414

* Quartile: Divide data into four eual parts,naming as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.

Q1 = 1 x ((n+1)/4)th item = Q1
Q2 = 2 x ((n+1)/4)th item = Median
Q3 = 3 x ((n+1)/4)th item = Q3
Q4 = 4 x ((n+1)/4)th item = Full Data

Example:
Find Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 for the following data:
3, 8, 5, 2, 6, 9, 4, 10
Solution:
1) arrange in acending order
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10

2) Put the formula and calculate the value

Q1 = 1 x ((8+1)/4)th item
   = 1 x 9/4th item
   = 1 x 2.25 th item
   = 2.25th item

3) Find the item value
2.25 will be lie b/w 2 and 3 on number scale

Q1 = 2.25th item
   = 2nd + 0.25th item
   = 3 + 0.25(3rd - 2nd)
   = 3 + 0.25(4 - 3)
   = 3 + 0.25*1
   = 3.25

this is our quartile one ,respectively you can find Q2,Q3 and Q4.


Respectively we have Decile and Percentile.

* Decile: Divide data into ten equal parts.

D1 = 1 x ((n+1)/10)th item
D2 = 2 x ((n+1)/10)th item
D3 = 3 x ((n+1)/10)th item
D4 = 4 x ((n+1)/10)th item
......
D10 = 10 x ((n+1)/10)th item

* Percentile: Divide your data into 100 equal parts.

P1 = 1 x ((n+1)/100)th item
P2 = 2 x ((n+1)/100)th item
P3 = 3 x ((n+1)/100)th item
P4 = 4 x ((n+1)/100)th item
......
P100 = 100 x ((n+1)/100)th item

------------------------------------------------
Why?
* we need Quartile , Decile and Percentile to check the Density or majority of our data from where to where.

* To identify the outliers.

Let us suppose we are analysing Titanic Dataset..
in our age column values are from 10 to 90

after applying any one or all three i.e Q, D, P..
we get to know that from 18 year to 36 year data density is more or we can say that more number of values or variation present in our data.
